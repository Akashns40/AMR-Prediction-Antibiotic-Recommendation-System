# AMR Prediction & Antibiotic Recommendation System

This project predicts antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and recommends suitable antibiotics for *Streptococcus mitis group* strains using Machine Learning.  
It includes a trained RandomForest model, PCA-based features, and an interactive Streamlit app.

## Features
- Predict AMR gene presence from genomic profiles  
- Predict resistance/sensitivity for multiple antibiotics  
- Recommend safest antibiotics based on probability  
- Upload gene list or select existing strain  
- Easy-to-use Streamlit web interface
